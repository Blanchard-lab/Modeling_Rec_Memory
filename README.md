# Modeling-Conscious-Recognition-Memory-A-Gaze-Based-Machine-Learning-Approach
We show that machine learning applied to eye-tracking can reveal distinct signatures of recognition memory. In VR studies, gaze features like saccades and pupil dilation differentiated familiarity from recollection, offering a non-invasive window into memory processes.
