# Modeling-Conscious-Recognition-Memory-A-Gaze-Based-Machine-Learning-Approach
We show that machine learning applied to eye-tracking can reveal distinct signatures of recognition memory. In VR studies, gaze features like saccades and pupil dilation differentiated familiarity from recollection, offering a non-invasive window into memory processes.

Process

1. Create features from the processed logs folder using perm_feature_gen.py

2. Copy the paths to the features you want to train on into one of the exp/permutation_feature_analysis/feature_dirs.txt
    ex: /home/exx/caleb/familiarity/feature-gen_feature-analysis/blink_features

3. run run_all_feature_subsets.py
